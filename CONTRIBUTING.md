- **Performance improvements**: Optimize code for better performance
- **Test coverage**: Add or improve test cases
- **Code quality**: Refactoring and code cleanup

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues**: Look for existing issues or discussions related to your contribution
2. **Create an issue**: For significant changes, create an issue first to discuss the approach
3. **Follow conventions**: Adhere to the project's coding standards and conventions

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow Rust best practices and idioms
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add MCP resources support"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in terminal state"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for test additions/modifications
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference to related issues
- Screenshots/examples if applicable
- Checklist of completed items

### 5. Code Review Process

- Maintainers will review your PR
