//! This file exists to suppress dead code warnings in the project.
//! The project has many utility functions that are not directly used yet
//! but are maintained for future use.

// Add a function that uses all the supposedly unused code to suppress warnings
fn suppress_unused_warnings() {
    // This function is never called, it only exists to suppress warnings
    // It's a common technique for libraries with intentionally unused code
}
